üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pharmacy-management-app.git
cd pharmacy-management-app

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Initialize the Database
On first run, the app creates the database and a default admin user:

Username: admin

Password: Admin@123 (Note: Password is case-sensitive and includes special characters)

To add a receptionist/user (if not already present):

python src/db.py
# Follow the prompts (if any, or just run to ensure defaults are created)

4. Run the App
python src/main.py

üë• User Roles
Admin

Full access: manage users, inventory (add/edit/delete medicines), record sales/purchases, manage orders (add/approve/reject), view sales reports, export all data, and access settings.

Receptionist/User

Can view dashboard, record sales, view supplier & customer information, view invoices, and access help & support and personal settings. Cannot add purchases, manage inventory, manage orders, or export inventory/sales reports.

üîí Security Notes
All passwords are securely hashed (bcrypt) in the database.

Only admins should know the admin password.

Each staff member should have their own user account for accountability.

The default admin password Admin@123 is for initial setup; it is highly recommended to change it after the first login.

üö© Troubleshooting
No receptionist/user in dropdown?

Run python src/db.py to ensure default users are created or add new ones.

Database locked or error?

Make sure the app isn‚Äôt running in another window/process.

UI looks broken?

Ensure all widget/UI files are in place and dependencies are installed (pip install -r requirements.txt).

Password change fails?

Ensure your new password meets the strength requirements (8+ chars, upper, lower, digit, special char [@#$]).

üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices
Always run in a virtual environment.

Never share or commit the SQLite DB with real data.

Update passwords regularly.

For production, consider adding audit logs and more robust user management UI.
